## Exercise I

a) Linear time, O(n): The time this code will take to run depends exclusively on the size of n. Time will increase as N increases, descrease as N decreases. And, only one operation is performed in the single loop. 


b) Polynomial time, O(n^3): A loop within a loop in this code makes the program very inefficient. There are also three iterations happening with each evaluation: establishing j in the first for loop; and, in the second loop, multipling j by 2 and also incrementing the sum. 


c) Linear time, O(n): The code will run exactly n amount of times. We see this in the return statement where the return depends on bunnies - 1. Therefore, runtime depends exclusively on the time of n.
